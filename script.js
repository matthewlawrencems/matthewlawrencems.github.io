  document.getElementById("dromedary-text").textContent = "Dromedaries, also known as Arabian camels, are a species of camel distinguished by their single hump. Native to the arid regions of the Middle East and North Africa, these resilient animals are perfectly adapted to desert life, capable of enduring extreme heat and going for long periods without water. Their hump stores fat, which can be converted to energy when food is scarce. Dromedaries have long legs that keep their bodies away from the hot ground, and their thick eyelashes and closable nostrils help protect against sandstorms. For centuries, they have been vital to human survival in desert environments, serving as transport animals and sources of milk, meat, and wool.";

Native to the cold deserts and steppes of Central Asia, particularly Mongolia and China, Bactrian camels are exceptionally well adapted to harsh climates, tolerating both freezing winters and scorching summers. Their thick fur provides insulation during the cold months and is shed in warmer seasons. The two humps store fat that can be converted into energy and water, allowing them to survive long journeys across barren landscapes. Highly valued by nomadic cultures, Bactrian camels have historically played a crucial role in trade along the Silk Road, carrying heavy loads across vast, inhospitable terrain.";
